# SOSideMenu

Since the Facebook first implemented Slide-Out drawer menu in their mobile app, the developer world went gaga over it. It become very popular in short period and it turned out to be very useful in other mobile apps as well.

Thus, I finally decided to create a demo on it and written a tutorial on [How to Create iOS Slide Out Menu Navigation Just Like The Facebook](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/create-ios-slide-menu-navigation-sidebar/).
